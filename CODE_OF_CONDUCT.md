# Open Source Community Guidelines

We sincerely value and appreciate your initiative in participating and contributing to our project.
Your involvement is instrumental in creating a platform that will significantly benefit a wide range
of developers, engineers, and students. Thank you for your commitment and support.

We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Not engaging in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or
  physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.

## Resolve peacefully

We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and
disagreement often yields positive results. However, it is never okay to be
disrespectful.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the
behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and
easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute.
If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is
threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an
environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

## Reporting problems

We take every report seriously and commit to a thorough investigation of each complaint. While you
may not receive a direct response, please know that your concerns are important to us. Our approach
to addressing reported incidents varies based on their nature and severity, ranging from no action
to permanent exclusion from the platform and related activities. We will inform the accused party
about the report and provide them an opportunity to respond before any decision is made. The
identity of the reporter will remain confidential and will not be disclosed to the accused. In
situations where there's a risk of ongoing harassment or a threat to safety, we may take immediate
action without prior notice.
